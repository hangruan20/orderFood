# PickYourFood
**A System to Order Food Online based on Spring, Hibernate and React**  
* Applied **Spring** framework with annotations to achieve the IoC idea and decouple all the components, **Spring MVC** to dispatch the **Rest API** requests, and **Spring Security** to provide authentication and authorization
* Used **Hibernate** to operate and store the data(e.g., customer, restaurants, etc) in **AWS RDS MySQL** database
* Constructed the front-end using **React** and **Ant Design**, enabling customers to use the application, including registration, ordering food online, checking out, etc
* Deployed the application on **AWS EC2**, and the demo is on http://18.216.94.202/
